## insertion_vs_myinsertion.cpp

I made an slight improvement to insertion algorithm by first comparing the element to be inserted with the first element of the sorted array and put the element to be inserted to the first if it is smaller than the first element of the sorted array. That makes some improvements to the worst case scenario.
